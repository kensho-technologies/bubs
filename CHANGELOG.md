#Changelog
###v0.0.1
Initial release.
###v0.0.2
Add `from_config()` function to the ContextualizedEmbedding object, which is called on deserialization. It turns pickled lists of lists back into original numpy arrays.
###v0.1.0
Change to `tf.keras` instead of keras because it's the future of keras and makes tensorflow version irrelevant.
